    "### Explanation:\n",
    "1. **`WITH failed_logins`**: This Common Table Expression (CTE) creates a subquery to calculate the number of failed login attempts by each user in a rolling 24-hour window. The `COUNT(*) OVER` function is used to count the failures per user, partitioned by `user_id`, and ordered by the `timestamp`. The `RANGE BETWEEN INTERVAL '1' DAY PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW` clause defines the 24-hour rolling window.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **`WHERE status = 'failure'`**: This filters the `login_attempts` table to include only the failed login attempts, ignoring the successful ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **`RANGE BETWEEN INTERVAL '1' DAY PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW`**: This part defines the 24-hour period to look at each login attempt in the past 24 hours for a specific user.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **`SELECT user_id, COUNT(*) AS total_failed_attempts`**: In the outer query, the `WHERE fail_count > 3` clause filters the results to include only users who had more than 3 failed login attempts. It then groups the results by `user_id` to return the total count of failed login attempts for each user.\n"
