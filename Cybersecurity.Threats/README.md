# Cybersecurity Threats and Incidents Visualization

## Project Overview
This project visualizes cybersecurity incidents using data collected from various security platforms. It uses **SQL queries** for data extraction, **Python** for analysis and processing, and **Matplotlib/Seaborn** for visualizations. The objective is to monitor, analyze, and present trends that support decision-making.
